N-Body Physics Simulation

Basic simulation of N-Body gravational interactions.
Simulation starts out with Sun, Earth and Moon.
Press keys "a" to "z" to add planets.
Simulation currently uses Euler's formula.
Physics update is done on every unique object pair therefore is O(0.5 * n^2)

* This project is mainly used to build and test vector libraries.
* Code is subjected to major revision.
